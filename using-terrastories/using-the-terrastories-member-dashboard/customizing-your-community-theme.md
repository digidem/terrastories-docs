# Customizing your community theme

{% hint style="info" %}
Customizing your community theme requires `admin` access. If you are logged in as an `editor`, `member`, or `viewer`, you will not be able to access this settings menu.
{% endhint %}

It is possible to set a few theme properties for your community (logged in as an `admin` user).

Currently, there are only two options:

* **Welcome Screen:** you can set a background image for your welcome screen, once a user has logged in.
* **Sponsor Logos**: you can add one or more logos to display on the welcome screen, once a user has logged in. These could be for your community, organization, sponsors, donors, or anything else.

In the future, we may make it possible to set more thematic properties for your community, such as color scheme. If you have ideas for feasible ways to allow users to modify their community theme, please [let us know](https://github.com/Terrastories/terrastories/discussions).
