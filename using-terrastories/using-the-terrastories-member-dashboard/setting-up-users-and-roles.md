# Setting up users and roles

{% hint style="info" %}
Managing users requires `admin` access. If you are logged in as an `editor`, `member`, or `viewer`, you will not be able to access this settings menu.
{% endhint %}

As an admin user, you can create, edit, and delete users that have access to your community in the **Users** view.

The Users view shows a list of all of the users that have access to your Terrastories community, and their respective level of access ("Role").

There are currently four **Roles** for a Terrastories community:

1. `admin` - has permission to view, add, or edit data (restricted and non-restricted); add or edit users; and change Theme settings.
2. `editor` - has permission to view, add, or edit data (restricted and non-restricted).
3. `member` - has permission to view data (restricted and non-restricted).
4. `viewer` - has permission to view data (non-restricted only).

There are several fields you can fill out for a User.&#x20;

* The ones that are required are **Username**, **Password** and **Role**.&#x20;
* The user's **Display Name** and **Photo** are currently only used in the content management system and a few areas on the main application, but we may start to use these more in the future.&#x20;
* It is also recommended setting an **Email** as we may make it possible in the future to permit users to recover their password if they've lost it.
