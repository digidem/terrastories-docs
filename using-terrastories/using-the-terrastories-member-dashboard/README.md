# Using the Terrastories member dashboard

To access the Terrastories member dashboard, you need to log in with credentials for a community that have either `editor` or `admin` access.

Once you have done so, you will see a link for **Admin page** (soon to be renamed "Member dashboard") on the welcome screen.

Click on that link to access the Terrastories member dashboard.

Upon accessing the member dashboard, you will be met with a message that you have signed in successfully. The default view that is shown is the Stories view.&#x20;
