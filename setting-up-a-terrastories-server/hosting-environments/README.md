A Terrastories server can be hosted in a number of different environments, online and offline. We have developed workflows for several use cases that we have commonly encountered; however, as an application deployed using virtualization through Docker, there are numerous other ways that Terrastories may be hosted.

Currently, we have workflows, setup scripts, and documentation for the following four hosting environments:

* [hosting-terrastories-online.md](hosting-terrastories-online.md "mention")**:** It is relatively easy to deploy Terrastories online, as most web applications are created for online usage and so services like Heroku, DigitalOcean, and others are designed to easy online employment. We currently have instructions designed for Heroku (where Digital Democracy hosts the [https://our.terrastories.app](https://our.terrastories.app) server) and hope to have instructions for other services soon. \

* [hosting-terrastories-offline-as-a-field-kit](hosting-terrastories-offline-as-a-field-kit/ "mention"): For an entirely offline use case, we have a workflow where Terrastories can be set up a computer which serves the application through a hotspot. Other devices connected to that hotspot can then load Terrastories through the browser.\

* :chocolate\_bar: **Hosting Terrastories on Kakawa (Earth Defenders Toolkit Offline)**: Terrastories also comes bundled on [_Kawaka_](https://www.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/deploy/). Please see the documentation for using Kakawa [here](https://docs.earthdefenderstoolkit.com/overview/introduction).\
