## Terrastories is a free and open-source application designed for communities to map, protect, and share place-based stories

**Terrastories** is a geostorytelling application built to enable Indigenous and other local communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them.

Community members can add places and stories through a user-friendly interface, and make decisions about designating certain stories as private or restricted. Terrastories works both online and offline, so that remote communities can access the application entirely without needing internet connectivity.

## \*\*\*Support Limitation Warning\*\*\*

1. It is not possible to self-host Terrastories, either online or offline, without assistance from a developer. This is due to maintenance issues on current dependencies in the codebase.
   * Documentation to guide someone executing these tasks is currently out of date.
   * We unfortunately are not able to offer this support to you.
2. For using Mapbox Studio maps on our.terrastories.app (or any Terrastories server), your maps need to be v2.x.x compatible. Please ask on the [Mapbox Discord](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/faq/mapbox-developers-discord/) for assistance.
3. Feature development is on hold for the foreseeable future.&#x20;
