## Terrastories is a free and open-source application designed for communities to map, protect, and share place-based stories

**Terrastories** is a geostorytelling application built to enable Indigenous and other local communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them.

Community members can add places and stories through a user-friendly interface, and make decisions about designating certain stories as private or restricted. Terrastories works both online and offline, so that remote communities can access the application entirely without needing internet connectivity.
