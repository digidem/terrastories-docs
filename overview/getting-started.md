# Getting started

{% hint style="info" %}
Before getting started working with Terrastories, you may want to first check out the [terrastories-demo.md](terrastories-demo.md "mention") and the [faqs.md](faqs.md "mention").
{% endhint %}

You might be wondering how you can get started using Terrastories, or just to try it out without committing to setting up your own Terrastories server.&#x20;

Digital Democracy does maintain an online Terrastories server at [**our.terrastories.app**](https://our.terrastories.app). There are a number of Indigenous and other communities actively using this server. You can also explore any public-facing stories from this server at [**explore.terrastories.app**](https://explore.terrastories.app/).

Currently, we don't have open registration to create your own account on this server, because we are paying for it, and we don't have a clear way to charge for usage (yet).

If you would like to request a community account on our server, even if just to try out the application, please [write to us ](mailto:info@digital-democracy.org)and let us know how you plan to use the online server. We'd be happy to create an account for you.
